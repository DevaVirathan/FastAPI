                                            FASTAPI 
                                            
FastAPI is a modern, high-performance Python web framework designed for building APIs. 
It leverages standard Python type hints to provide automatic data validation, serialization, and 
interactive documentation, making it a popular choice for developing robust and scalable web services.

Key Features of FastAPI:

High Performance: FastAPI is built on Starlette for the web parts and Pydantic for data validation, enabling performance comparable to frameworks like NodeJS and Go.

Automatic Interactive Documentation: It automatically generates interactive API documentation (using OpenAPI, formerly Swagger UI, and ReDoc), which simplifies testing and understanding API endpoints.

Data Validation and Serialization: FastAPI utilizes Pydantic models to define data schemas and automatically validate request data, ensuring data integrity and reducing boilerplate code for error handling.

Asynchronous Support: It fully supports Python async and await syntax, allowing for efficient handling of 
I/O-bound operations and improving application responsiveness.

Dependency Injection: A built-in dependency injection system promotes modular and testable code.

Ease of Use: Designed to be intuitive and easy to learn, especially for developers familiar with Python type hints.
